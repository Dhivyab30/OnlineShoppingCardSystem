# OnlineShoppingCardSystem

Introduction:
--------------

The Online Shopping Cart System is a mini-project implemented in Java using the Collection Framework. It simulates the basic functionalities of an e-commerce shopping application where users can browse products, add/remove items to/from a cart, checkout, and view their order history.
The project is menu-driven and runs on the console. It demonstrates real-world use cases of Java Collections (Arraylist, HashMap, Linkedlist) in a modular, object-oriented design.

Objectives:
-----------

To implement a shopping cart system using Java Collections.

To demonstrate Arraylist for storing products, HashMap for managing cart items, and Linkedlist for order history.

To design a menu-driven system for user interaction.

To provide object-oriented modular design with multiple classes (Product, Cart, Order, Shopping System, Main).

Conclusion:
-----------


The Online Shopping Cart System is a simple Java project that uses the Collection Framework to manage products, cart items, and order history. It shows how Arraylist, HashMap, and linkedlist can be used effectively in real applications. The project is easy to use, menu-driven, and demonstrates the basic idea of an online shopping system in a clear and practical way.
